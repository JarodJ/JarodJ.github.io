Gurgamoth is a flying fighting game where the level is your weapon.Gurgamoth is the perfect mix of party chaos and competitive strategy, ideal for sitting around on the couch with a couple of friends.Your only weapon is the level itself: a shifting battlefield with different hazards.  Gurgamoth is fast, relying on quick timing, but also your ability to read your opponent.  Will they dodge your attack and send you flying into a spinning saw blade?  Will they spend their attacks on a power-up, leaving them temporarily vulnerable?  Will they anticipate your attack and stun you while you're recovering?
