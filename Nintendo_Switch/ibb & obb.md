## Description

Outsmarting gravity together.

ibb & obb is a two player cooperative game set in a puzzle filled world where gravity goes both up and down. You can only succeed by working closely together.

Find a friend for some true local cooperative couch fun or match up online.

Fall up and jump down through 15 levels filled with double gravity puzzles and discover 8 hidden worlds that will test your new non-Newtonian skills to the maximum.

All levels have their own unique music, composed by Kettel known for his warm melodic electronica.
