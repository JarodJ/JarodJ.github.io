## Description

Rally your friends and hold your ground!Rally your friends and hold your ground!
NO HEROES HERE is a co-op game for one to four players. Coordination and cooperation are your key weapons to success - everyone must play a role in the battles to come and work together as a team to protect the castles and Kingdom from imminent doom.
The enemy hordes have struck with terror and chaos. The King's broken army and fallen heroes cannot protect you from harm. It is up to you to protect the realm and restore Noobland to glory!

- 1 to 4 players 
Invite all your three friends to play with you! Two? One...? None?! Then revel in our single player mode, if playing solo is your style! If not...

- Local and online multiplayer
Play with your friends either locally or online. No friends? No problem! Join an online match with other Non-Heroic figures all over the world!

- 2 Game Modes: Normal and Nightmare
Is Normal mode not challenging enough? Nightmare mode offers the frighteningly ominous reality of a true horde invasion!
