## Description

50% bird, 50% man, 100% ridiculous.Plant seeds, grow guns, be the bird-man you always wished you could be.

A group of intergalactic super heroes has come to your world, bringing with them a tale of mystery and complete nonsense. Explore, level-up, find secret treasures, and challenge yourself to some good ol' classic jump'n'shoot action in this retro-inspired action/platformer/RPG-lite.
