## Description

Death Road is built for replay value. Everything is randomized: locations, events, survivor appearances and personalities. There's a different story every time you play, set in a world that doesn't take itself too seriously.

Features:
• Up to 500 zombies can hunt you down at a time. Fight them, squirm past, or run.
• Use the character creator to put yourself, friends, and family in the game.
• Find special and rare events, weapons, and characters with strange abilities.
• Make tough choices in Interactive Fiction events. Get different options and results based on party member traits.
• Tell people to "Cool it."
• Teach a dog how to drive a car.
• 4 player local co-op and control up to 4 characters!
