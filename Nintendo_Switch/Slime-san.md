## Description

Aid Slime-san in his escape from a giant worm!

Slime-san was minding his own business, sliming around in a peaceful forest when suddenly…A giant worm appeared and gobbled him up! Now deep within the worm’s belly, Slime-san has to face a decision: Be digested by the incoming wall of stomach acid... Or jump, slide and slime his way through the worms intestines and back out its mouth!

No time to stay still as you are chased by a wall of acid at every corner! Run, run, run!

Being a slime has its perks. Slime your way through cracked walls and surfaces!

Slime to slow time, dash to speed it up. Feel like an absolute hero with pixel precise maneuvers!
