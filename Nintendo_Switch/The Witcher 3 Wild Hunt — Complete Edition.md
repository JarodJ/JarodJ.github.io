## Description

Winner of over 250 Game of the Year awards, The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt is a story-driven, open world adventure set in a dark fantasy universe.

You are Geralt of Rivia, mercenary monster slayer. At your disposal is every tool of the trade: razor-sharp swords, lethal mixtures, stealthy crossbows, and powerful combat magic. Before you stands a war-torn, monster-infested continent you can explore at will. Your current contract? Tracking down the Child of Prophecy, a living weapon that can alter the shape of the world.

The Complete Edition contains every piece of downloadable content released for the game, including two massive story expansions: Hearts of Stone & Blood and Wine. It's the perfect opportunity to enter this world for the first time or relive the adventure — on the go!

Features

-NEW: Cross-play between PC and Nintendo Switch with Cloud Saves.
Pick up your adventure through the world of The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt exactly where you left off when playing on GOG and Steam — and vice versa!

-A gigantic open world to explore.
Visit the luxurious and corrupt city of Novigrad, face the frigid cold of the wind-swept Skellige islands, and challenge the dark forces roaming the forlorn, ravaged No Man’s Land. Sail through open seas, dive in search of long lost artifacts or gallop your mount into combat — the world of the Witcher beckons to be explored.

-Unparalleled novel-like story spanning over 150 hours of gameplay.
With over 100 hours of core and side-quest gameplay and over 50 hours of additional content, The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt combines the intense, plot-driven pull of traditional RPGs with the freedom of choice only open world games can offer. Make choices and face their consequences to unlock endings tailored to how you play.

-Now on Nintendo Switch™ — play at home and on the go.
Developed to take advantage of everything Nintendo Switch™ has to offer, the game delivers a truly powerful on-the-go experience.
