## Description

awake. head throbbing. vision blurry. come light the fire.A Dark Room is an innovative text-based adventure that harkens back to the magic of Zork, adding a modern spin on a classic genre and time in gaming. 

It challenges the playerâ€™s perceptions, actions and imagination. Visually clean, A Dark Room presents text and cues with limited visual flourishes, but the experience that takes shape is full of depth and environmental storytelling. Audio is also important, portraying a dark world that the player can only imagine.

It is a game that draws players in, allowing them to perceive the intriguing world in their own way. What starts as a dark room with limited interactive options evolves into a complex story and resource management challenge.

Adapted especially for the platform, you can play with physical controls or the touch screen; exclusive to this version of the game is an enhanced user interface and local co-op play.

A Dark Room is an experience, and a story, unlike any other.
