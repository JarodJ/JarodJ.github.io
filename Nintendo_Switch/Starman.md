ATHMOSPHERIC
Starman is not only a game, but a whole experience. We've put so much love building the sceneries, and trying to create an eerie atmosphere. Sit, relax, and enjoy.

GAMEPLAY
We crafted more than 30 puzzles inside 24 levels, across 9 totally different chapters, to keep you playing between 1.5h and 3h.
It's short and sweet.

FLOW MODE
When you finish the main story, an endless flow mode will be unlocked for you.

NINDIE
Starman is our first game. 100% Indie, developed with love in spain by sergio abril and jacobo abril, two brothers that happen to be architects.
