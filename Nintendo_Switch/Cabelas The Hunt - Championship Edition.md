## Description

Hunt Like a Pro

Cabela’s: The Hunt is the most exciting hunting game to the Nintendo Switch™. You will experience the thrill of the hunt while you stalk and kill your prey in some of North America's most famous hunting spots. With local multiplayer, arcade mini-games and season hunt modes, Cabela’s: The Hunt is fun for gamers and hunters alike. 

• Three Gameplay Modes: Multiple modes allow players to jump right in or play for hours at higher levels of difficulty. Cabela’s: The Hunt offers modes for both casual and dedicated players - Quick Hunt, Season Hunt and Cabela’s Challenges. 

• True Hunting Experience: Adding authenticity, once the hunter finds the target, many factors come into play before pulling the trigger: range, scent, stalking ability, and more. 

• Variety of Equipment: Players will need to select the appropriate weapons, supplies and gear to successfully stalk their prey. Players' arsenal includes rifles, shotguns, side arms, and bows as well as a wide variety of calls, scents, blinds, decoys, scopes, an ATV and state-of-the-art GPS mapping technology to aid in their hunt. 

• Epic Prey: Hunt Whitetail Deer, Mule Deer, Elk, and Moose. There are also "Legendary Animals" in each region - coveted trophies including King of Bucks (Bass Pro Shops collection of record sized Whitetail bucks), deer, bears, cougars, coyote, wolves, boars, big horned sheep, turkeys, ducks and more. 

• Realistic Settings: Hunters will have ten beautiful realistic expansive environments to explore, each filled with a variety of prey, dangerous animals, hidden landmarks, and fun quick-action missions.
