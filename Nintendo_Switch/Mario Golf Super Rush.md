## Description

Golf with a Mushroom Kingdom twist!

Hit the green with up to four players locally* or online** and golf with friends from the Super Mario™ series like Mario, Peach, Yoshi, and more! Modes range from Standard Golf to the energetic Speed Golf and an exciting Golf Adventure. Simple motion or button controls make it easy for both new players and seasoned pros to drive and putt.

Pick up the pace in Speed Golf and Battle Golf

Tee off at the same time with up to three other players* and race through the course to get your ball in first. Mayhem is par for the course as you hinder your opponents with dashes and Special Shots. Yoshi can dash atop a giant egg and King Bob-omb can pelt the green with explosions! In Battle Golf, watch out for obstacles like Thwomps, Chain Chomps, and banana peels as you navigate the neon-themed Super Golf Stadium.

Rise through the ranks in Golf Adventure

Enroll your Mii™ character in golf training at the famous Bonny Greens country club and go from beginner to pro! The stakes are high—you must also watch out for Wario and Waluigi’s tricks and even battle fearsome bosses. You’ll face off against your Mushroom Kingdom classmates and level up your character. You can bring your character (and their customized stats) into other modes, too.

Choose from one of 16 characters from the Super Mario series and hit the green in several modes! Take it slow in Standard Golf and choose from 3-18 holes across 6 different courses that range from lush scenery to windy wilds. Intuitive controls and a shot gauge that adapts to the curve of the course make it easy for both new players and seasoned pros to drive and putt. Characters include Mario Golf veterans like Mario, Luigi, and Peach. Characters like Pauline and Chargin’ Chuck are also here to make their debut on the green.

In addition to the frenetic Speed Golf, you can also enjoy simultaneously swinging in Battle Golf. The neon-soaked Super Golf Stadium has 9 open holes—first player to get 3 flags wins! Use obstacles, including Thwomps, Chain Chomps, Bob-ombs, and banana peels to your advantage. Up to four players* can join the fast and flashy fun.

Start your Golf Adventure as a rookie in Bonny Greens, birthplace of the sport in the Mushroom Kingdom. After learning the game at this classic country club, you’ll compete for the next badge, allowing you to journey across the land playing a variety of courses and their clever variants of the sport. You’ll meet new coaches, master new skills, and hunt for buried treasure on your quest to turn pro. Things get weird when Wario shows up, but what else is new? It’s not called Golf Adventure for no reason. Save par, save the world. All in a day's golf!
