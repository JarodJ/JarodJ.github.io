## Description

Grab those Joy-Con controllers and get jumping!Jump rope virtually and watch the on-screen counter increase with each successful hop! Another player can join in on the fun with another Joy-Con™ controller as you strive for a high score.By using a pair of Joy-Con controllers and imagining them as the handles of a jump rope, players can virtually jump rope every day. With hopping bunnies as the characters, simple menus and no long tutorials to jump through, it’s quick and easy to learn the ropes. You can even skip in style with a number of outfits and backgrounds!For those who aren’t able to jump, or are worried about disturbing the downstairs neighbors, players can bend their knees or move their arms to play the game without creating any noise.Jump Rope Challenge was created by a small group of Nintendo developers while working from home in Japan as a simple game to add some quick and fun movement into their daily lives.Make sure to stretch properly before play. Game play requires varying amounts of physical activity.Consult a doctor before playing if:

・you are or may be pregnant,

・you have heart, respiratory, back, joint or other orthopedic conditions,

・you have high blood pressure,
