Featuring hundreds of your favorite characters and moments from your favorite episodes from all the seasons of Family Guy, Bob's Burgers, Futurama, American Dad, and King of the Hill. Collect character cards, optimize your deck, and create new combos as you fight in an epic card battle bacchanal.

The game may be digital, but the stakes are real!* The fate of the world rests in your hands!**

(*Stakes are not real.)  
(**The fate of the world does not rest in your hands.)

Hilarious bosses, big rewards, and lots of challenge. What does Futurama's Space Bee say when you play a strong card? How does American Dad's 70s Hot Tub react to winning a battle? Adventure away to find out.

What happens when you combine Fry and Money? We think you know. But how about making a Beefsquatch, a $300 Knife, or Pro Bass Hank? Collect cards and put them together to find out.

Earn Hero tokens to level up your favorite characters: from Bender to Consuela, from Bobby to Zapp Brannigan.

Battle against other players, unique bosses, and other crazy combinations of events to earn exclusive rewards, new cards, and lots of loot!
