## Description

Big map. Big dinosaurs. Big guns. Face an ever changing threat level with your friends. Second Extinction is an online co-op FPS with a bite.

The goal is simple: Reclaim Earth.

In Second Extinction you take on hordes of mutated dinosaurs with up to two friends. Solo players beware: Second Extinction is designed with squads in mind. Only the strong will survive.

The goal of Early Access is also simple: Work with our community to make the best game possible.  
We want to hear your feedback loud and clear, and we intend for our community to be a vital part of the development process.  
Even so, there’s plenty to get your teeth (and claws) into from day one: 6 heroes, 12 weapons (with 5 upgrade tiers each) and 6 missions - plus some special side quests - across multiple regions of our big map.

Our mantra is that players win battles, communities win wars. Nowhere is this more true than our War Effort feature. Each region of our big map has a unique threat level. This threat level can be  
lowered if enough of our players are successful in their missions and activities. But the dinosaurs aren’t resting either, and they’ll focus their efforts where you aren’t.  
Each week the community will see the fruits of their labours or feel the  
consequence of their incompetence. Let the threat level get out of control and you can expect an especially tough Emergence Event to be waiting for you.

By playing Second Extinction you’re not just picking up another co-op shooter.  
You’re joining us on a journey as we shape the experience. Every piece of feedback and every mission you play matters. So what are you waiting for? The fight to reclaim earth starts here.
