## Description

The only urban futuristic free-to-play Battle Royale where 100 contenders compete to become the next superstar.

Hyper Scape™ is the one and only urban futuristic free-to-play Battle Royale where 100 contenders engage in first-person close-quarters combat and fast-paced matches to become the next global superstar.

In 2054, technology is everywhere. AI, cyber-augments, and security for the ones who can afford it… But for the bottom 90%, life is a daily challenge. The only way to rise to the top and change your lot in life is to compete in an intense urban Battle Royale taking place in the virtual world of the Hyper Scape.
