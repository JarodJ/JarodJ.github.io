Mars has been colonized. Now, Earth's greatest corporate titans have been invited to build companies to support it. The competition to dominate the market is fierce in this fast-paced economic RTS from Civilization IV lead Designer, Soren Johnson.

With space travel becoming a reality and the easy-to-reach resources on Earth dwindling, hopeful people seeking their fortune are rushing to the next great frontier: Mars.

Determine the fate of the Martian colonization effort in the dynamic single-player campaign mode. Multiple types of CEOs deliver many hours of discovery into their motivations and how they intend to dominate the future of Mars.

With a robust and exciting multiplayer mode that can support up to eight players, no two games are the same! The market fluctuates depending on which of the four starting corporations you and your opponents choose and what resources you accumulate.

Market forces are your weapons, not guns or bombs. In order to win, you will need to make tough choices on what resources to acquire, what goods to build and sell, how to interact with the planet's thriving underworld, and what stocks to acquire and when.
