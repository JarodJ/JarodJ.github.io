Defense Grid: The Awakening is the ultimate tower defense game that appeals to players of all skill levels. A horde of enemies is invading, and it's up to the player to stop them by strategically building fortification towers around their base. The controls are intuitive and the gameplay is deep — the special attacks and properties of each tower work together to provide many ways to succeed. 

Defend the cores!

PC Gamer Magazine Editor’s Choice Award (90/100)

There are approximately 8 hours of gameplay in the main story line, and many additional hours of play in challenge modes that give players unique starting conditions and objectives. Each game level is very replayable, and can be solved in many different ways, with increasing rewards for improved efficiency.

Defense Grid: The Awakening has 20 unique environments, each with a different placement of roads, tower build locations, and open areas to plan a strategy around. 

Over the course of the game, players battle 15 different enemy types that become increasingly stronger, and employ a variety of strategies in an attempt to bypass the player's defenses. As the levels progress, the enemies become tougher and more difficult to defeat.

There are 10 different tower types with 3 levels of capability each. Each tower has unique trade offs that affect ideal placement, such as line-of-sight attack or ballistic trajectory fire. Some towers improve other nearby towers, and some are ideal at specific locations, such as a rear guard tower that unleashes a devastating attack

Successfully completing each level provides a bronze achievement award. Additional goals provide silver and gold awards for a particular level. A novice player may be able to survive the onslaught, but only an experienced player will be able to get all of the gold achievements.

Protect the cores and and you too can hold the top spot on the overall leaderboards or against your friends! Beware, the competition is fierce! You must optimize your strategy if you want to stay on top!
