Shadow Tactics is a hardcore tactical stealth game set in Japan around the Edo period

Take control of a team of deadly specialists and sneak in the shadows between dozens of enemies. Choose your approach when infiltrating mighty castles, snowy monasteries or hidden camps. Set traps, poison your opponents or completely avoid enemy contact.

The group is composed of very different personalities

Working together as a team seems impossible at first. Yet over the course of many missions, trust is won and friendships are made. The characters develop their own dynamic and each member will have to face their own personal demons.

One of the leaders of this team is Hayato, an agile ninja, who clears the way through his enemies silently

Samurai Mugen prefers a more powerful approach and can defeat more fiends at once. Aiko is a master of camouflage when she distracts enemies disguised as a Geisha. The street child Yuki places traps and decoys enemies. Takuma relies on his sniper rifle.

The player has to carefully evaluate his options in order to master the challenging missions: 

How will the characters behave as a team? Which one is best equipped for each task? How can they best master the given missions? Come up with your own ingenious tactics to vanquish enemies and complete missions.
