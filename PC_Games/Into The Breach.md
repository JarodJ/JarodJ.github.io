## Description

Control powerful mechs from the future to defeat an alien threat. Each attempt to save the world presents a new randomly generated challenge in this turn-based strategy game from the makers of FTL.

Civilian buildings power your mechs. Defend them from the Vek and watch your fire!

All enemy attacks are telegraphed in minimalist, turn-based combat. Analyze your opponent's attack and come up with the perfect counter every turn.

Find powerful new weapons and unique pilots as you battle the Vek infestation across Corporate-Nation islands.

Failure is not an option. When you are defeated, send help back through time to save another timeline!
