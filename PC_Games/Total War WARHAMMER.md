## Description

The critically-acclaimed Total War: WARHAMMER combines a turn-based campaign of epic empire-building with colossal and explosive real-time battles, set within the incredible world of Warhammer Fantasy Battles. 

Hundreds of hours of gameplay await you at the dawn of a new era. Total War: WARHAMMER brings to life a world of legendary heroes, towering monsters, flying creatures, storms of magical power and regiments of nightmarish warriors.

Embark on campaigns of conquest as the valiant men of the Empire, the vengeful Dwarfs, the murderous Vampire Counts and the brutal Orcs and Goblins of the Greenskin tribes. Each Race is wholly different with its own unique characters, campaign mechanics, battlefield units and play style.
