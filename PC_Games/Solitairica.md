Solitairica takes RPG combat and challenging rogue-like progression to a fresh new place—the world of solitaire!

In the land of Myriodd, all of the hearts have been broken by the horrible Emperor Stuck!

The great Kismet will teach you to battle enemies with the power of solitaire and the four energies—attack, defense, agility and willpower

Each player’s journey will be a unique challenge, with a horde of ever-changing enemies and a wide variety of items and spells to explore. Battle your enemies with brute force, or clever builds with devastating combos. 

Defeat the Armies of Stuck!

● Procedural enemies that combine hilarious and dangerous traits for endless variety.
