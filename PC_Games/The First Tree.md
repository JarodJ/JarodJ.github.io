## Description

A beautiful, 3rd-person exploration game centered around two parallel stories: a fox trying to find her missing family, and a son reconnecting with his estranged father in Alaska. Uncover artifacts from the son's life as they  journey towards The First Tree.

For fans of Journey, Firewatch, and Shelter.

Players take control of the fox on a poignant and beautiful journey that crescendos at the source of life, and perhaps result in an understanding of death. Along the way, players can uncover artifacts and stories from the son's life as he becomes intertwined in the foxâ€™s journey towards The First Tree.

Not a "fox simulator," but an emotional, intimate story by a one-man team with an ending you won't soon forget.

Featuring a gorgeous soundtrack by acclaimed artists like Message to Bears, Lowercase Noises, and Josh Kramer.

A short game (about an hour and a half) focused on story with some light puzzle solving, platforming, and no enemies.
