## Description

Experience an atmospheric hunting game like no other in this realistic and visually breathtaking open world. Immerse yourself in the atmospheric single player campaign, or share the ultimate hunting experience with friends.

Never before have you experienced a hunting game like theHunter: Call of the Wild. Plunge into an atmospheric open world, teeming with life: from the majestic true-to-life animals to the rustling of leaves above you as you stalk your prey. You can decide to hunt on your own or join up and hunt together with friends. Just remember, you are not just a visitor in this world, you are a living and breathing part of it. As you finally spot the majestic crown of your first red deer through the brush, the feeling is indescribable.

Each reserve is meticulously crafted to be as convincing as possible, letting you step into different regions of the world and traverse its rich biomes. Soon you will learn which animals prefer to travel through which terrains, analysing their authentic behaviors, traits and movement patterns to better pursue them. Then itâ€™s up to you to make an assessment of the value of your target, from the size and symmetry of the antlers of a red deer to the weight and unique plumage of a canada goose, to determine if the animal is worth taking the shot for.

Create your own Hunting experience. With a wide range of options, stretching from rifles to bows, each with different types of ammunition and suited for differently sized animals, it&#x27;s up to you to find your favourites and regularly practice your aim as you account for wind and bullet drop alike. Additionally, you have various callers and scents to allow you to lure your target towards you, setting up the perfect spot to finally line up the shot.

theHunter: Call of the Wild offers unique multiplayer options. It is up to you whether you decide to collaborate or compete, as there are several in-game challenges and frequent hunting events that you can all pursue. Additionally, if you want to visit and hunt in one of the paid DLC reserves, you can simply join the game of someone who owns it and get to hunting.

theHunter: Call of the Wild continues to evolve, with regularly released free and paid content to help enrich the overall experience. From new reserves and different weapon and equipment packs to a more realistic generation of antlers and horns (TruRACs), the team is constantly striving to add more to the game.
