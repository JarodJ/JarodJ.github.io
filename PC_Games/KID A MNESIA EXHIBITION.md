## Description

An upside-down digital/analogue universe created from original artwork and recordings to commemorate the coming of age of Radiohead’s Kid A and Amnesiac.

KID A MNESIA is a fevered dream-space, an edifice, built from the art &amp; creatures, words &amp; recordings of Radiohead’s Kid A and Amnesiac uncovered from 20 odd years ago, reassembled and given new mutant life.

Stanley Donwood and Thom Yorke’s twisted anxious artwork and writing made to accompany the music of Radiohead’s Kid A and Amnesiac is uncovered and brought back to life, in a building hidden in a forest made in pencil, stretching the idea of what an exhibition is to breaking point.. or into something else entirely.

The original multitrack recordings of Kid A and Amnesiac are scattered and reformed in a series of impossible or possible spaces populated by equally impossible or possible creatures, surrounded by the art of Stanley Donwood and Thom Yorke, created as the millenium loomed.
