## Description

Welcome to a world of intrigue and suspicion. Where humans and robots contend with escalating tensions and mutual distrust. And where gangster felines scheme their way to the top of the food chain. Welcome to the Tales of the Neon Sea!

Investigate the murder scene, examine the evidence, and use your powers of deduction to solve the case, piece by piece. Once the mist has cleared, will you see the truth - or uncover an even bigger mystery?

Stunningly detailed retro-style pixel-art, coupled with modern atmospheric lighting and sumptuous visual effects, bring this unique cyberpunk world to life. Evocative music and sound design build layers of suspense and mystery, every step of the way.

A variety of hilarious, exhilarating achievements are waiting to be uncovered as you explore a rich and detailed background story.  
Hooked on collectors' fever? You won't want to miss this.

Puzzles that will challenge your powers of logic, observation skills and patience! These challenges skillfully combine narrative and environmental elements designed to augment your journey in this weird and vibrant world.

Feeling lonely on this odd adventure? Take control of a special 'assistant': William the black cat. William can travel deeper into areas our detective can’t reach - often proving decisive in identifying and retrieving key evidence!

If robots had their own god, what would it look like? And if they had the same rights as humans… would they betray us?  
When there are no boundaries between flesh and machine… what is life?  
This eccentric cyberpunk world holds all the answers…
