## Description

EVE Online is a free-to-play community driven space MMO where players can choose their own path from countless options. Experience space exploration, immense PvP and PvE battles, mining, industry and a thriving player economy in an ever-expanding sandbox!

EVE Online is the largest single shard space MMO of all time. With over 7,000 solar systems and nearly 20 years of rich player-created history, join this storied universe and play free to experience everything from immense PvP or PvE battles to mining, exploration, and industry.

Experience this vast spaceship MMO for free as an Alpha Clone with access to Frigates, Destroyers, Cruisers, Battlecruisers, and Battleships of any faction. Enterprising Capsuleers may also choose to upgrade to Omega Clone for unlimited Ship access and double training speed.

As a single sharded MMO, all players of EVE Online play on the same server across all timezones. Jump in and join thousands of players in the greatest space sandbox there is. Every decision you make, battle you win, and system you claim becomes a part of the long, rich history of New Eden. Where will you leave your mark?

There's no limit on what you can accomplish as a Capsuleer. EVE currently holds the Guinness World Record for the largest multiplayer video game PvP battle - 8,825 players in a single conflict. Take part in massive spaceship battles from day one or train up and command those fleets yourself.

EVE's player economy is one of unprecedented scale. The single shard nature of the universe makes for a single economy spread across thousands of space stations. Whether you want to trade on the local markets, produce new ships and equipment, or make cunning investments based on knowledge of player politics, it's all possible.

Pursue a life of exploration, warfare, prosperity, or all of the above! Pilot over 350 different vessels and customize it to your liking with thousands of unique modules. Modify your ship as a fast and nimble fighter or design it from the ground up as a heavily shielded brawler to go toe to toe with others. Feeling lucky? Take a chance and modify your equipment further using alien technology found deep in Abyssal Deadspace.

With over 18 years of active development and free expansions, EVE is one of the longest running space MMOs out there. Join a thrilling universe filled with the unrelenting activity and combined history of millions of other players!
