## Description

Help a wandering warrior monk complete her woeful errand in Superbrothers: Sword &amp; Sworcery EP, the landmark action-adventure crafted by Superbrothers and the video game wizards at CAPY, featuring an award-winning original soundtrack by Jim Guthrie.

Superbrothers: Sword &amp; Sworcery EP is an exploratory action adventure with an emphasis on audiovisual style. Traverse a mythic little realm, use a sword to do battle &amp; evoke sworcery to solve mystical musical mysteries, and help a wandering warrior monk complete her woeful errand.

Superbrothers: Sword &amp; Sworcery EP features an album's worth of original music by noted composer Jim Guthrie as well as artwork &amp; designs by Superbrothers Inc, crafted &amp; engineered by videogame wizards at Capy in Toronto, Canada.

Jim Guthrie's legendarily epic Sword &amp; Sworcery LP: The Ballad of the Space Babies is a landmark prog rock concept album from the noted composer. Jim's compositions were named "The Best Videogame Music of 2011" by Kotaku, while Double Fine's Tim Schafer said "The music is amazing. I want Jim Guthrie to score my life."

Guide a warrior monk on a laid back adventure in a bronze age mountain wilderness, overcome battles &amp; solve mystical musical puzzles to help The Scythian complete her woeful errand.

Explore a lavishly-painted mythopoetic storyworld affected by real-world moon phases, conceived &amp; crafted by a representative at Superbrothers Inc.

Treat your ears to an album's worth of original music created by the legendary composer Jim Guthrie.

This edition of S:S&amp;S EP for the electric computer has been faithfully re-engineered by videogame wizards at CAPY to support input via the two-button mouse.
