## Description

Idle Champions is a licensed Dungeons &amp; Dragons strategy management video game uniting iconic characters from novels, campaigns, and shows into one epic adventure. 

You start with iconic Dungeons &amp; Dragons characters like Bruenor Battlehammer from R.A. Salvatore's Forgotten Realms novels, Jaheira from Baldur's Gate, and you unlock additional Champions through adventures and events, like Drizzt Do'urden, Farideh, and Jim Darkmagic.

Gameplay gets deeper with each Champion you unlock. Master formation strategy to complete hundreds of adventures in a fantasy world based on official Wizards of the Coast D&amp;D books like Waterdeep: Dragon Heist, Tomb of Annihilation, and Curse of Strahd.

Collect renowned Champions from the world of Dungeons &amp; Dragons, including fan-favourites from the Force Grey series. Unlock more Champions and gear to add to your party in limited-time events.

Mastering the position of each Champion to maximize their special abilities is the key to completing each adventure. Each Champion's abilities and gear requires careful thought to create the best combination. Only the most powerful formations will defeat the waves of Dungeons &amp; Dragons monsters.

Take your Champions on a journey through the Sword Coast. Players will be able to explore familiar locations within the Forgotten Realms as they tackle each adventure.

The game is updated regularly with limited-time events. Completing events unlocks new Champions and gear to add to the player's collection.

Your adventure continues even when you're not playing. Set-up your perfect formation and let your Champions battle monsters to earn gold while you are away from your computer.

Choose to unlock the Champion you want if you missed their limited-time event.

Revisit and replay your favourite adventures with new challenging restrictions for even greater rewards.
