## Description

Three years after the Necromorph infestation aboard the USS Ishimura, Isaac Clarke awakens from a coma, confused, disoriented, and on a space station called The Sprawl. Just as his health begins to improve, The Sprawl is overrun with even more advanced forms of the alien-zombie hybrids. Explore this open world and its massive zero-gravity environments to discover the truth about the Unitology cult and its role in the Necromorph epidemic. Will you survive or let the madness claim you, too?

Game Features:

Enter the Sprawl. The threat facing Isaac is no longer confined to a singular space station. You'll face Necromorphs in Zero G environments. Strap on your suit boosters, blast through the Church of Unitology, and jet across the Solar Array.

Fight a deadlier enemy. New Necromorph breeds await, including the stealthy Stalker strain and creepy, infested children known as The Pack. Use your unconventional arsenal of traditional firearms, like the mine-shooting Detonator, and weaponized engineering tools, like the rapid-fire Rivet Gun, and you just might make it out alive.

Are you crazy? Delve into the mysteries surrounding the Necromorph infestation and learn more about Isaac Clarke's tortured past. You may even catch a glimpse of the elusive engineer's face as he interacts with the precious few survivors aboard The Sprawl.
