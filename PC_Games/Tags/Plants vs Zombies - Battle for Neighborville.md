## Description

Welcome to Neighborville, where all is well. Except that a crazy, new, coniferous conflict between brain-less and botanicals is brewing! What are you gonna do, call the crops? Soil your plants? Prepare to kick some grass in a plant-on-zombie conflict that will take you to the outer edges of Neighborville and back again.

KEY FEATURES

Venture to the Outer Edges of Neighborville - The tension across the terra has expanded with free-roam regions that extend beyond the town of Neighborville. Squad up with up to 3 friends in the Giddy Park social region and take back Weirding Woods, Mount Steep and Neighborville Town Centre. It’s grow time!
