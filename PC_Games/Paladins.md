Join 30+ million players in Paladins, the free-to-play fantasy team-based shooter sensation. Wield guns and magic as a legendary Champion of the Realm, customizing your core set of abilities to play exactly how you want to play.

Paladins is set in a vibrant fantasy world and features a diverse, ever-expanding cast of Champions with unique abilities, ranging from sharpshooting humans to mech-riding goblins, mystical elves, and jetpack-clad dragons.

Paladins is completely Free-to-Play. Anything that affects gameplay can be unlocked simply by playing, with cosmetic items available for purchase.

With Paladins' deckbuilding system, you can choose from dozens of abilities to become an iron sights sniper, a grenade-slinging explosives expert, or a track star with an assault rifle – all as the same Champion.
