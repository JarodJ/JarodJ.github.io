Only the world’s most ruthless Warden can contain the world’s most ruthless inmates. Design and develop your personalized penitentiary in Prison Architect.

Allocate resources to optimize your compound, but don’t restrict the flow of the crowd lest you encounter a flood, fire, fight, or full-blown riot.

Tap federal money with grant applications &amp; direct your funds to combat disease, gang activity, litigation, and more!

Ensure your prison is mostly ethical and safe with top-notch staff including armed guards, psychologists, doctors, lawyers and snitches.

Each prisoner’s criminal history requires custom treatment programs, labor schedules, and reform workshops.

Attempt a high-stakes escape of your own supermax prison in Escape Mode, or try Online mode to test one of 12,000 player-created prisons. Expand your empire limitlessly in Sandbox mode.
