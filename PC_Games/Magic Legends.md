## Description

Become a Planeswalker in Magic: Legends, an Online Action RPG set in the Magic: the Gathering Multiverse. Ancient forces move in the darkness and it’s up to you to walk the planes of the Magic Multiverse, to gather the power needed to fight this evil.

Choose your path through diverse planes, collect unique spells, Artifacts, and Equipment to create powerful loadouts, and control the chaos of battle as you fight to save the Multiverse from its greatest threat yet.

Rise to the challenge and save the Multiverse from its greatest threat yet. Harness the power of five different classes – but don’t worry about picking just one. You can switch between all five as you play.

You’ll need to cross diverse planes and regions to save the Magic Multiverse, but how you weave your path is up to you.

Make fast, tactical decisions on the battlefield in real-time combat. Strategically build a deck of spells from your spell library, which will be drawn at random as you fight. Whether you wield the power of White, Blue, Black, Red, or Green mana - your choices determine how you navigate the battlefield.

Discover and cast a myriad of spells and collect spell pages to make them more powerful. Acquire and utilize Equipment and Artifacts to synergize with your deck in order to craft your desired playstyle.

Traverse the planes alone or with up to two other Planeswalkers. Prepare unique loadouts to build on your teammates’ strengths.
