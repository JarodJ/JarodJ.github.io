The Queen's been captured and her kingdom is in peril; only you and your friends have any chance of restoring peace to this eccentric, enchanted land. Blast your way through treacherous forests, spooky crypts, and fearsome fortresses, but bewareâ€”your journey can change in an instant on account of Tina's gleefully chaotic whims.

Choose your character from a roster of six unique Vault Hunters, each with their own signature abilities and powerful builds, and jump into chaotic fantasy battles right away in solo or co-op

There's no telling what'll happen next with Tina as your Bunkermaster! Be ready for anything (especially hungry Mimics masquerading as treasure chests)

Vanquish any villains who get in your way using a huge assortment of souped-up firearms, all while firing Lightning Bolts and Fireballs from your fingertips with spellcast-style grenade mods
