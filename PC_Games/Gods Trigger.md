## Description

Slay enemies with speed and precision in an over-the-top show of blood and explosions. Play solo or with others, make split-second decisions, dodge bullets, and use weapons and abilities to inflict violence in the most graphic way possible.

Godâ€™s Trigger is a power fantasy where you dispatch enemies with speed and precision in a balet of blood and explosions.  
Burst through a room in seconds killing with one of the many weapons, freely selectable special abilities, environmental hazards, and melee attacks.

Make split-second decisions, dodge bullets and inflict violence in a highly stylized, fast-paced bloodbath.  
Each character brings their own unique powers. With a treasure trove of weapons and customizable special abilities you have the means to annihilate your enemies in just the way you like.

Switch freely between Harry and Judy, the Angel and the Demon, at any moment in solo mode, or grab a friend and work together in co-op for even greater bloodshed!
