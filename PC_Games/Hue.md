## Description

Hue is a vibrant, award-winning puzzle-adventure, where you alter the world by changing its background color. Includes full colorblind support, using symbols as a color aid

Hue is a vibrant, award-winning puzzle-adventure, where you alter the world by changing its background colour.

You explore a dangerous grey land, unearthing coloured fragments on a journey to find your missing mother.

As obstacles match the background, they disappear, creating new and exciting puzzles - full of peril, mystery… and colours unseen.

Unique colour-matching mechanic, offering a new twist on the classic adventure game.

A heartfelt story that touches on themes of love, loss, existence and remorse.

A world full of lively characters to talk to, each with their own personality and story.

Stark silhouetted art style with bright, bold colours.

Over 30 original music tracks, composed exclusively for Hue. 

Professionally voiced narration by Anna Acton and Matthew Wade, some of the UK’s best television talent.

Full colourblind support, using symbols as a colour aid.

Razer Chroma, Corsair RGB plus many more coloured LED devices supported on Windows

One of the most original and engrossing platform puzzlers of recent years

Overall, the game is amazing. Beautiful and brilliant, sophisticated and simple, challenging and compelling.

Hue is easily one of the best additions to the genre in a very long time.
