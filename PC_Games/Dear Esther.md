## Description

'A deserted island... a lost man... memories of a fatal crash... a book written by a dying explorer.'

Dear Esther immerses you in a stunningly realised world, a remote and desolate island somewhere in the outer Hebrides. As you step forwards, a voice begins to read fragments of a letter: 'Dear Esther...' - and so begins a journey through one of the most original first-person games of recent years.

Abandoning traditional gameplay for a pure story-driven experience, Dear Esther fuses its beautiful environments with a breathtaking soundtrack to tell a powerful story of love, loss, guilt and redemption.
Key features:

    Every play-through a unique experience, with randomly generated audio, visuals and events.
    Explore incredible environments that fully immerse you in the haunting island and its mysterious past.
    A poetic, semi-randomised story like you've never experienced in a game before.
    Stunning soundtrack composed by Jessica Curry, featuring world-class musicians.
    An uncompromisingly inventive game delivered to the highest AAA standards. 


Dear Esther: Landmark Edition has been remade with the Unity engine, featuring a full audio remaster, and the addition of a brand-new Directors' Commentary mode, allowing players to explore the island and learn what inspired the game and how it was crafted by The Chinese Room and Rob Briscoe.
