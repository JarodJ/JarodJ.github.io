# Dog Info

## Feeding
They each get 2 cups of food in the morning and afternoon. So 4 cups total per dog per day.

There are two large white containers in the middle bedroom (across from the bathroom) on the floor right as you walk in. There is a measuring cup in one of the containers and I store their bowls in there as well. I give each dog 1 cup from each container at every meal.

They eat a variety of Blue Buffalo varieties. I generally just buy them from Petsmart in store. Then I put one variety in one of the containers and another variety in the other just for diversity. These are examples of what I feed although other varieties are fine as well. [Blue Buffalo Life Protections Formula Lamb and Rice](https://www.petsmart.com/dog/food/dry-food/blue-buffalo-life-protection-formulaandtrade--adult-dry-dog-food---natural-lamb-5079775.html) and [Blue Buffalo Life Protections Formula Fish and Rice](https://www.petsmart.com/dog/food/dry-food/blue-buffalo-life-protection-formulaandtrade--adult-dry-dog-food---natural-fish-5108730.html)

In the morning I usually feed Kix from a bowl that is designed to slow him down because he eats really quickly otherwise. It is the black bowl that has a bunch of dividers in it. I don't think it's harmful to not do that. He has never actually choked or anything but it just makes it take longer and closer to the time Bacon takes.

In the afternoon I usually feed them from food dispensing toys that are kept next to the food containers in a blue rubbermaid container. This is just to make it take longer for them to eat and make it more interesting for them. It's not necessary.

I generally feed Kix in the master bedroom and Bacon in the kitchen/dining room. They won't really fight over food so it's not a big issue but I prefer to give them their own space.

They eat at 5:15am and again around 4-6pm.


## Medication
All the medication is stored in the kitchen cabinet in the leftmost upper cabinet between the sink and door to the deck.

### Bacon Phenobarbital
Bacon gets phenobarbital twice a day at 5:15. It is critical that he gets it every day and within a half hour or so of that time. Long term the time could be slowly changed to another time but then it would need to stay consistent at 12 hours apart.

Currently he gets two different pills of different dosages at each time. So he gets one 32.4 mg pill and one 16.2 mg pill both in the morning and evening.

I don't like getting pills out of the full bottles every day and risk spilling all the pills. So I'll separate out a week or so worth into an old pill bottle and just add more as needed. So each dosage is normally spilt between two bottles if you are looking for them. They are all in that cabinet though and not too difficult to figure out with some looking. 

He takes them without a problem hidden in food. He will eat most anything so there are tons of options. Usually what I do is buy bags of frozen mixed vegetables from the grocery store and then keep some in a bowl in the fridge that I add to his meals. I've found it's pretty easy to hide the pills in either green beans or brocolli or cauliflower depending on the mix of vegetables. He never really spits pills out but occasionally they might fall out as he's chewing so what I do is put the pills in whatever and then hand them to him first and make sure he eats them and then I will give him the rest of his food. But you can also use any other kind of food from peanut butter to mashed potatoes to leftovers to most anything. The pills are pretty small and don't seem to have much taste so it's really not much of a problem.

The pills don't necessarily need to be given with food. In the morning I always just feed them at the same time but in the afternoon I will sometimes have fed them earlier or later depending on what's going on and it's fine. As long as the pills are given at the right time that's the only thing that matters. 

### Heartwom and Flea/Tick
They both get [Inteceptor Plus](https://www.chewy.com/interceptor-plus-chew-dogs-501-100/dp/172984) for heartworm prevention on the 15th of every month.

And they get [Simparica](https://www.chewy.com/simparica-chewable-tablet-dogs-441-88/dp/173129) for flea/ticks on the 1st of every month.

 
## Vets
Because Kix gets carsick I've now started taking him to a vet much closer so that it is less stressful on everyone.

### Other Vet Info
For quick access to rabies certificates there are copies in my car behind the passenger seat in a folder in the seat pocket.

All the main records are stored in the middle bedroom where the dog food is on the white cabinet on the top shelf in a purple folder.

Bacon's rabies is good through 6-17-2024 and Kix's is good through 4-7-2025.

Kix just goes to the vet once a year for a checkup and heartworm check.

Bacon needs to go every 4 months for a phenobarbital check and every 6 months for a general checkup.
